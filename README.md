- **Shark Investment Insights:** Developed tools for sharks to calculate investment returns and explored which shark has the most diversified portfolio across various industries.

By cleaning the data with Python, this project provides accurate insights into funding trends, investor behaviors, and strategic growth opportunities for startups.
